# Overview

Focus on the fact that yesterday's content was intended to show you the capabilities of TAS and see it in action.  But in reality, Deploying an app through the CLI is rarely done by a human in a production or pre-production environments.  These things are left to robots running your pipeline.

So, we are going to look at a real live pipeline that does most of the actions we covered yesterday.
